# VTS-Sharp v2.0.1
A C# client interface for creating VTube Studio Plugins with the [official VTube Studio API](https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio), for use in Unity and other C# runtime environments!

## IMPORTANT! 
If you are updating your project from using a 1.x.x version of the library to using a 2.x.x version of the library, please read [the migration guide](#what-changed-in-200), as the project was restructured in version 2.0.0 to decouple it from the Unity Engine, allowing it to be more easily used in other C# environments!
 
## About
This library is maintained by Tom "Skeletom" Farro. If you need to contact him, the best way to do so is via [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/fomtarro) or by leaving an issue ticket on this repo.

If you're more of an email-oriented person, you can contact his support email: [tom@skeletom.net](mailto:tom@skeletom.net).

This library can also be found on the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/vts-sharp-203218), but this repo will always be the most up-to-date version.
 
## Usage
In order to start making a plugin, follow these simple steps:
1. [Check to see which packages from this library you need for your project based on your C# environment](#packages). 
    * If you are using Unity, make a class which extends `VTS.Unity.UnityVTSPlugin`. 
    * If you are using any other C# environment, make a class which extends `VTS.Core.CoreVTSPlugin`, or which has one as a member variable. 
2. In your class, call the [`Initialize`](#void-initialize) method on the plugin, which will attempt to connect to VTube Studio and authenticate the plugin. 
    
    This method has you pass in your preferred implementations of:
    * A [JSON utility](#interface-ijsonutility)
    * A [websocket](#interface-iwebsocket)
    * A [mechanism to store the authorization token](#interface-itokenstorage). 
    
    It also has you specify what happens when:
    * The plugin connects to VTube Studio successfully
    * The plugin disconnects from VTube Studio
    * The plugin encounters an error while attempting to connect to VTube Studio 
3. Once your plugin is authenticated, you can call any method found in the [official VTube Studio API](https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio), which are built-in as appropriately named methods on the `VTSPlugin` class!

And that's it! In fact, if you're using Unity, these steps are all done for you already, out of the box, in the `MyFirstPlugin` class found in the `Examples/Unity` folder!.
 
You can find a video tutorial that demonstrates [how to get started in under 90 seconds here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUGeMEVzjAU).

## Design Pattern and Considerations
 
### Swappable Components
In order to afford the most flexibility (and to be as decoupled from Unity as possible), the underlying components of the [`VTSPlugin`](#interface-ivtsplugin) are all defined as interfaces. This allows you to swap out the built-in implementations with more robust or platform-compliant ones. By default, the `MyFirstPlugin` class features working implementations of all needed components, but if you want, you can pass in your own implementations via the [`Initialize`](#void-initialize) method.

### Asynchronous Design
Because the VTube Studio API is websocket-based, all calls to it are inherently asynchronous. Therefore, this library follows a callback-based design pattern.
Take, for example, the following method signature, found in the [`VTSPlugin`](#interface-ivtsplugin) class:
 
```
void GetAPIState(Action<VTSStateData> onSuccess, Action<VTSErrorData> onError)
```
The method accepts two callbacks, `onSuccess` and `onError`, but does not return a value.

Upon the request being processed by VTube Studio,
one of these two callbacks will be invoked, depending on if the request was successful or not. The callback accepts in a single, strongly-typed argument reflecting the response payload. You can find what to expect in each payload class in the [official VTube Studio API](https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio).

This library also supports the [VTube Studio Event Subscription API](https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio/blob/master/Events/README.md). With this feature, you can subscribe to various events to make sure your plugin gets a message when something happens in VTube Studio. Event Subscription follows a similar asynchronous design pattern.
Take, for example, the following method signature, found in the [`VTSPlugin`](#interface-ivtsplugin) class:

```
void SubscribeToTestEvent(VTSTestEventConfigOptions config, Action<VTSTestEventData> onEvent, Action<VTSEventSubscriptionResponseData> onSubscribe, Action<VTSErrorData> onError)
```
The method accepts an optional configuration class, and three callbacks, `onEvent`, `onSubscribe` and `onError`, but does not return a value.

Upon successfully subscribing to the event in VTube Studio, the `onSubscribe` callback will be invoked, and then `onEvent` will be invoked any time VTube Studio publishes an event of that type. If the subscription fails for any reason, `onError` will be invoked.

## What Changed in 2.0.0?

### Packages
As of version 2.0.0, the library has been split into two folders/packages: `VTS/Core` and `VTS/Unity`. The `VTS/Core` folder contains everything needed to build a plugin in any C# runtime environment, with no engine-specific code. The `VTS/Unity` folder contains Unity-specific wrappers for the core classes, allowing you to easily build a plugin as a Unity GameObject, following the original design of this library. If you are not looking to use Unity for your project, you can completely discard the `VTS/Unity` folder. However, if you *are* using Unity for your project, you will need both the `VTS/Core` and `VTS/Unity` folders, as the Unity components serve as wrappers for the Core library.
 
### Breaking Changes
As of version 2.0.0, a few fundamental and breaking changes have been introduced in the interest of decoupling the library from Unity. If you are updating your project from using a 1.x.x version of the library to using a 2.x.x version of the library, please completely remove the library from your project, and re-import it while being aware of the following changes:

* Namespaces have been totally reorganized. The two remaining namespaces are `VTS.Core` and `VTS.Unity`. These correspond to the aformentioned [packages](#packages).
* The `VTSPlugin` MonoBehaviour class has been renamed to `UnityVTSPlugin`, and moved into the `VTS.Unity` namespace. As such, please update your plugin classes to extend `VTS.Unity.UnityVTSPlugin`.
* The `VTSWebSocket` MonoBehaviour class has been totally removed. You may safely remove it from any game objects. This class now exists as a pure C# equivalent.
* Several of the built-in dependencies of the `Initialize` method have changed in various ways:
    * The `IJsonUtility` interface now has a `NewtonsoftJsonUtilityImpl` implementation that is suitable for all uses, leveraging the much more robust [Newtonsoft JSON library](#newtonsoft-jsonnet).
    * The existing `ITokenStorage` implementation `TokenStorageImpl` now requires a root path to be passed in via the constructor. For Unity applications, you likely want to use `Application.persistentDataPath`, ex `new TokenStorageImpl(Application.persistentDataPath)`.
    * The existing `IWebSocket` implementation `WebSocketSharpImpl` now requires an `IVTSLogger` to be passed in via the constructor. For Unity applications, you can use the builtin logger from the `VTSPlugin` MonoBehaviour, ex `new WebSocketSharpImpl(this.Logger)`
    * The `onError` callback method now accepts an `VTSErrorData` argument.
